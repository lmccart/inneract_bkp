<p class="center">Inneract is an iPhone app that creates a new layer augmenting normal social space. It allows you to determine your own desired interactions outside the bounds of what is normally acceptable and make them known through a layer that only other users can see. Choose any interaction you would like to have, and post it with your picture. Other users nearby will see your invitation and can choose to engage with you. Or, explore the whims of others and participate!
<br/><br/>
You can see the desired acts of everyone in the world, but you can only see the pictures of those within a mile of you. Your act remains visible until you clear the act field or completely quit the app.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Android version coming soon!</strong>
