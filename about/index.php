<p class="highlight">Inneract is a project by media artist <a href="http://lauren-mccarthy.com">Lauren McCarthy</a>. It was created in response to the expectations of appropriate and polite behavior she often feels limited and sort of intimidated by. This project follows up on some of the ideas explored in previous works like the <a href="http://lauren-mccarthy.com/happinesshat">Happiness Hat</a> and other <a href="http://lauren-mccarthy.com/socialinteracting">Tools for Improved Social Interacting</a>, <a href="http://lauren-mccarthy.com/conversacube">Conversacube</a> and <a href="http://lauren-mccarthy.com/script">SCRIPT</a>.</p>
